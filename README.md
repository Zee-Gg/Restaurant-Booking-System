 **Restaurant-Booking-System.**
 
This project is a simple web-based restaurant reservation form that allows users to book a table by filling out their details. The form is validated, and the reservation details are stored locally before displaying a confirmation page.
 **Features**
 
Date Picker: The form includes a date picker implemented using the Pikaday library.
Form Validation: Basic validation is done to ensure that all required fields are filled out before the form is submitted.
LocalStorage: Reservation details are stored in the browser's localStorage to persist data between pages.
Confirmation Page: After submission, users are redirected to a confirmation page where their reservation details are displayed.
